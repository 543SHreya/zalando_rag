It neither includes B2B revenues (e.g. ZEOS services) nor other B2C revenues (e.g. Partner business commissions, Zalando Marketing Services and service charges like express delivery fees); these are included in revenue only. GMV is recorded based on the time of the customer order. **) Adjusted EBIT is defined as EBIT before equity-settled share-based payment expenses, restructuring costs, acquisition-related expenses and other significant non-operating one-time effects. ***) Calculated based on the last 12 months (LTM). ****) As of 30 September 2024 and 31 December 2023, respectively Zalando SE Quarterly Statement Q3 2024 1.1 Financial performance of the group Condensed consolidated income statement 9M/24 in m EUR 9M/24 As % of revenue 9M/23 As % of revenue Change GMV 10,618.1 146.0 % 10,172.6 143.5 % 2.5 pp Revenue 7,273.0 100.0 % 7,086.9 100.0 % 0.0 pp Cost of sales"

An industry- wide strong start to the autumn/winter season in the third quarter significantly contributed to our 9M growth trajectory. As of 30 September 2024, the number of active customers reached 50.3 million, compared to 50.1 million in the prior-year period. GMV per active customer increased by 1.8% to 299.6 EUR (prior-year period: 294.4 EUR) driven by a 3.8% rise in average basket size to 61.1 EUR (prior-year period: 58.8 EUR), which compensated for lower average orders per active customer of 4.9 at the end of Q3 2024 (prior-year period: 5.0).

All KPIs were calculated on the basis of the last 12 months. Revenue increased by 2.6% to 7,273.0m EUR (prior-year period: 7,086.9m EUR) on the back of a positive development in our retail business 1, a continuously growing partner business and strong revenue growth of 11.5% in B2B. The difference between GMV and revenue development is inherent in our partner business model where selling prices are fully reflected in the GMV metric, while revenue only includes the commission income on the selling price. Furthermore, revenue from our Zalando Marketing Services (ZMS) as well as from our B2B segment, including Zalando Fulfilment Solutions (ZFS) and our newly launched multi-channel offering, are considered in revenue but not in GMV. Based on the improved gross profit margin and a lower fulfilment cost ratio, we generated an adjusted EBIT of 292.6m EUR in 9M 2024 (prior-year period: 167.3m EUR). 9M 2024 adjustments comprised expenses for equity-settled share-based payments of 62.2m EUR (prior-year period: 63.2m EUR) and acquisition-related expenses of 15.0m EUR (prior-year period: 14.5m EUR) as well as one-time income effects of 9.6m EUR (prior-year period one- time expense effects: 16.4m EUR) relating to the subletting of our warehouse in Bydgoszcz, Poland. The adjusted EBIT margin improved to 4.0% (prior-year period: 2.4%). Our gross margin increased by 1.8 percentage points to 40.3% in 9M 2024 driven by a successful sell-through of our retail inventory, further supported by a strong start to the autumn/winter season in September that allowed for a higher share of full price sales. Additionally, a growing partner business contributed as it comes with structurally higher gross profit margins. Compared to the prior-year period, fulfilment costs as a percentage of revenue decreased by 1.8 percentage points to 23.4%, attributed mainly to favourable order economics, reflected in a higher average basket size and cost reductions as well as the scaling of our ZEOS fulfilment business. Marketing expenses rose to 637.0m EUR (prior-year period: 498.3m EUR), with the marketing cost ratio reaching 8.8% of revenue, an increase of 1.7 percentage points compared to prior- year period. We deliberately increased investments in performance marketing to make use of the strong momentum. Additionally, we increased brand marketing as we launched several key 1 Report on economic position 2 Selected financial information 3 Service 3 Zalando SE Quarterly Statement Q3 2024 1 Formerly known as wholesale and offprice business campaigns to drive demand and enhance brand visibility, some of which highlighted the “Summer of Sports” and our latest brand positioning campaign called “What do I wear?” Administrative expenses amounted to 365.6m EUR (prior-year period: 369.8m EUR) and, as a percentage of revenue, decreased to 5.0% (prior-year period: 5.2%).

Other operating expenses decreased to 12.6m EUR (prior-year period: 46.1m EUR) primarily due to the one-off costs in 2023 related to the reshaping program that comprised expenses for severance and garden leave payments as well as related consulting fees. Considering our financial result of -32.5m EUR (prior-year period: -31.8m EUR) and income taxes of -61.4m EUR (prior-year period: 0.2m EUR), our net income significantly improved to 131.1m EUR (prior-year period: 10.0m EUR) in 9M 2024. 1.2 Results by segment Segment results of the group 9M/24 in m EUR B2C B2B Total Recon- ciliation Total group GMV 10,618.1 — 10,618.1 0.0 10,618.1 (prior year) (10,172.6) (— ) (10,172.6) (0.0) (10,172.6) Revenue 6,592.6 688.5 7,281.1 -8.1 7,273.0 (prior year) (6,478.2) (617.5) (7,095.7) (-8.8) (7,086.9) thereof intersegment revenue 0.0 8.1 8.1 -8.1 0.0 (prior year) (0.0) (8.8) (8.8) (-8.8) (0.0) Adjusted EBIT 274.9 19.3 294.1 -1.6 292.6 (prior year) (135.0) (32.2) (167.3) (0.0) (167.3) Adjusted EBIT margin (as %) 4.2 % 2.8 % 4.0 % — 4.0 % (prior year) (2.1 %) (5.2 %) (2.4 %) (— ) (2.4 %) Share-based payments 56.0 6.2 62.2 0.0 62.2 (prior year) (58.2) (4.9) (63.2) (0.0) (63.2) Acquisition-related expenses 2.5 12.5 15.0 0.0 15.0 (prior year) (1.2) (13.3) (14.5) (0.0) (14.5) One-time effects -9.6 0.0 -9.6 0.0 -9.6 (prior year) (16.4) (0.0) (16.4) (0.0) (16.4) Restructuring costs 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 (prior year) (30.6) (0.8) (31.5) (0.0) (31.5) EBIT 225.9 0.6 226.5 -1.6 225.0 (prior year) (28.5) (13.1) (41.7) (0.0) (41.7) 1 Report on economic position 2 Selected financial information 3 Service 4 Zalando SE Quarterly Statement Q3 2024 Segment results of the group Q3/24 in m EUR B2C B2B Total Recon- ciliation Total group GMV 3,458.5 — 3,458.5 0.0 3,458.5 (prior year) (3,209.3) (— ) (3,209.3) (0.0) (3,209.3) Revenue 2,151.5 239.7 2,391.2 -2.8 2,388.5 (prior year) (2,063.0) (215.8) (2,278.8) (-3.9) (2,274.9) thereof intersegment revenue 0.0 2.8 2.8 -2.8 0.0 (prior year) (0.0) (3.9) (3.9) (-3.9) (0.0) Adjusted EBIT 86.7 6.7 93.4 -0.7 92.7 (prior year) (10.6) (12.6) (23.2) (0.0) (23.2) Adjusted EBIT margin (as %) 4.0 % 2.8 % 3.9 % — 3.9 % (prior year) (0.5 %) (5.8 %) (1.0 %) (— ) (1.0 %) Share-based payments 15.6 1.9 17.5 0.0 17.5 (prior year) (20.0) (1.9) (21.9) (0.0) (21.9) Acquisition-related expenses 0.8 3.9 4.8 0.0 4.8 (prior year) (0.9) (4.5) (5.4) (0.0) (5.4) One-time effects 1.0 0.0 1.0 0.0 1.0 (prior year) (16.4) (0.0) (16.4) (0.0) (16.4) Restructuring costs 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 (prior year) (-1.6) (0.1) (-1.6) (0.0) (-1.6) EBIT 69.3 0.9 70.2 -0.7 69.5 (prior year) (-25.0) (6.1) (-18.9) (0.0) (-18.9) In line with our updated strategy to build the leading pan-European fashion and lifestyle e-commerce ecosystem, we are expanding our capabilities around two sets of customers: B2C and B2B.

From Q1 2024 onwards our external reporting was adjusted accordingly to reflect these two operating segments. 2 The B2C segment, which covers the majority of our business, includes our formerly known fashion store, offprice as well as our platform service ZMS. GMV in the B2C segment, which is equal to group GMV, increased by 4.4% in 9M 2024 and reached 10,618.1m EUR (prior-year period: 10,172.6m EUR). This development was supported by successful demand activation across our lifestyle propositions, such as sports. An industry- wide strong start to the autumn/winter season in the third quarter significantly contributed to our 9 months trajectory. Revenue in the B2C segment increased by 1.8% in 9M 2024, 2.6 percentage points below the GMV growth rate, as the partner business share continued to grow. 1 Report on economic position 2 Selected financial information 3 Service 5 Zalando SE Quarterly Statement Q3 2024 2 For further information please see our annual report 2023 in sections 2.1.2 Group structure and 2.1.3 Group strategy. In 9M 2024, our adjusted EBIT in the B2C segment reached a strong level of 274.9m EUR compared to 135.0m EUR in the prior-year period. The adjusted EBIT margin in the B2C segment was at 4.2% (prior-year period: 2.1%), driven by improved gross margins and lower fulfilment costs which were partially offset by increased marketing spend. The majority of the adjusted EBIT improvement was realised in the third quarter, as we successfully capitalised on rising consumer demand amid an industry-wide strong start to the autumn/winter season. The B2B segment covers our B2B services we offer to our partners on and off our Zalando platform. B2B products contain our recently launched ZEOS brand (including ZFS, our multi- channel offering and Tradebyte) as well as Highsnobiety. As mentioned above, B2B does not contribute to GMV. Revenues in B2B continue to outgrow group revenues and showed an increase of 11.5%, reaching 688.5m EUR (prior-year period: 617.5m EUR), with ZFS being the major growth driver. The B2B segment recorded an adjusted EBIT of 19.3m EUR in 9M 2024 compared to 32.2m EUR in the prior-year period. Adjusted EBIT margin reached 2.8%, down from 5.2% in the prior-year period due to front-loaded investments. 1.3 Cash flows The group’s condensed statement of cash flows is presented in the following table: Condensed statement of cash flows in m EUR Q3/24 Q3/23 9M/24 9M/23 Cash flow from operating activities -91.9 -81.1 287.8 123.3 Cash flow from investing activities -40.1 -71.3 -135.2 -154.8 Cash flow from financing activities -45.1 -29.7 -291.0 -91.3 Net change in cash and cash equivalents from cash relevant transactions -177.0 -182.1 -138.5 -122.8 Change in cash and cash equivalents due to exchange rate movements 0.3 8.3 -5.3 -0.1 Cash and cash equivalents at"

Positive effects arose from our operating income (considering that our net income comprises non-cash expenses like depreciation and share-based payments), partly compensated by the negative development of our net working capital. 1 Report on economic position 2 Selected financial information 3 Service 6 Zalando SE Quarterly Statement Q3 2024 In comparison to 9M 2023, the improvement in cash flow from operating activities of 164.5m EUR resulted primarily from the positive development of our operating income and lower income tax paid less refunds. This is partly compensated by effects from the collection of VAT receivables in Poland in H1 2023, which is reflected in other assets and liabilities. Cash flow from investing activities was mainly impacted by capex amounting to 140.2m EUR (prior-year period: 147.3m EUR) in 9M 2024. It predominately consisted of investments in logistics infrastructure related to the fulfilment centres in Germany, France and Poland, as well as capex in internally developed software. As a result, our free cash flow improved in 9M 2024 by 174.3m EUR to 147.6m EUR, from -26.6m EUR in the prior-year period. In 9M 2024, the cash flow from financing activities predominately consisted of payments for the repurchase of treasury shares of 99.5m EUR (prior-year period: 0.0m EUR) as part of our share buyback programme, payments of the principal portion of lease liabilities amounting to 99.0m EUR (prior-year period: 95.5m EUR) as well as the repurchase of convertible bonds of 95.5m EUR (prior-year period: 0.0m EUR). Overall, cash and cash equivalents remained strong at 2,389.4m EUR as of 30 September 2024 (31 December 2023: 2,533.2m EUR). 1.4 Financial position The group’s financial position is presented in the following condensed statement of financial position: Assets in m EUR 30 Sep, 2024 31 Dec, 2023 Change Non-current assets 2,467.2 30.7 % 2,540.5 32.6 % -73.3 -2.9 % Current assets 5,575.7 69.3 % 5,249.2 67.4 % 326.4 6.2 % Total assets 8,042.8 100.0% 7,789.7 100.0 % 253.1 3.2 % Equity and liabilities in m EUR 30 Sep, 2024 31 Dec, 2023 Change Equity 2,505.7 31.2 % 2,373.1 30.5 % 132.5 5.6 % Non-current liabilities 1,334.5 16.6 % 1,890.4 24.3 % -555.9 -29.4 % Current liabilities 4,202.7 52.3 % 3,526.2 45.3 % 676.5 19.2% Total equity and liabilities 8,042.8 100.0% 7,789.7 100.0 % 253.1 3.2% 1 Report on economic position 2 Selected financial information 3 Service 7 Zalando SE Quarterly Statement Q3 2024 Compared to 31 December 2023, our total assets increased slightly"

The statement of financial position is dominated by property, plant and equipment, net working capital, as well as cash and cash equivalents. During 9M 2024, non-current assets comprised additions to intangible assets amounting to 65.8m EUR (prior-year period: 58.2m EUR). Additions to property, plant and equipment totalled 57.6m EUR (prior-year period: 92.2m EUR), primarily relating to our fulfilment centres in Germany, France and Poland. The effects were compensated by depreciations. The development of current assets by 326.4m EUR was essentially driven by an increase in inventories, reflecting our inbound preparation for the autumn/winter season. Equity increased by 132.5m EUR to 2,505.7m EUR as of 30 September 2024 (31 December 2023: 2,373.1m EUR), primarily due to our positive total comprehensive income and our share-based compensation effects of the period. The development was partly offset by the repurchase of treasury shares (99.5m EUR) as part of our share buyback programme. The equity ratio increased from 30.5% at the beginning of the year to 31.2% as of 30 September 2024. Our non-current liabilities decreased by 555.9m EUR due to a partial repurchase of Tranche A convertible bonds with a principal amount of 100.0m EUR from May until July 2024 and the subsequent reclassification of the remaining Tranche A convertible bonds to current liabilities as they will become due on 6 August 2025. Besides this, the development of our current liabilities was essentially driven by the increase in trade payables and similar liabilities by 292.4m EUR to 3,074.3m EUR as of 30 September 2024. Suppliers’ claims against Zalando, totalling 588.2m EUR as of 30 September 2024, were transferred to various factoring providers (31 December 2023: 590.1m EUR). These balances were recognised under trade payables and similar liabilities. The development was partially offset by a decrease in other financial liabilities of 81.6m EUR to 152.1m EUR as of 30 September 2024, mainly impacted by the effects of the valuation of our hedging instruments. Net working capital, consisting of inventories and trade and other receivables less trade payables and similar liabilities, increased from -441.8m EUR as of 31 December 2023 to -246.4m EUR as of 30 September 2024. 1 Report on economic position 2 Selected financial information 3 Service 8 Zalando SE Quarterly Statement Q3 2024 1.5 Outlook Based on the stronger than expected consumer demand in the third quarter and amid an industry-wide strong start to the autumn/winter season, we have upgraded our outlook for 2024 on 10 October 2024.

Revenue growth is expected to be between 2% to 5% (from previously 0% to 5%), translating to 10.3bn EUR to 10.7bn EUR. Adjusted EBIT FY 2024 is now expected to come in between 440m EUR and 480m EUR (from previously 380m EUR to 450m EUR). With regard to capex, we further adjusted the speed of our investments in our logistics network considering network utilisation. Consequently, our capex investments 2024 are lowered from initially 250m EUR to 350m EUR to now around 200m EUR.
